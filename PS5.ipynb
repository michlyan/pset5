Let the variable inter_pair= 0 or 1, where 1 means there was a similar patent filed in a certain geographic area in the US. You will use a linear probability model to compare the probability of interference between patent pairs above and below different co-location thresholds of inventors within 10, 50 and 100 miles. You will also estimate a logit specification, interpret marginal effects, and perform hypothesis testing. \n"
